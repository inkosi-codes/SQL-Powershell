# SQL-Powershell
The purpose of this is to explore and create a robust library of SQL Powershell scripts for everyday use. 
I know there are a multitude of other resources out there that have already explored this narrative, but I wanted to do it my way with the help of the community.
These will be my first time using GITHUB to publish and collaborate so I foresee there to be a lot of ups and downs. Overall I am happy for any inputs and welcome all collaborations.
Also the larger goal is to create this large scale deployable SQL Powershell Console that would help not just the accidental DBAs but also the experienced ones as well.
